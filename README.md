# **KMeans Clustering**

This repository provides a step-by-step implementation of the KMeans clustering algorithm, including the mathematical concepts, Python code, and visualizations. The project uses the "Mall Customers" dataset to demonstrate clustering and includes detailed explanations of each step, from data preparation to statistical analysis of clusters.
